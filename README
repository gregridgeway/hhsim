HHSIM: Software for simulating two-stage hierarchical models in
"Flexible Prior Distributions for Triple-Goal Estimates in Two-Stage
Hierarchical Models," by Paddock, Ridgeway, Lin, and Louis.

Results of its methodology can be found in S.M. Paddock, G. Ridgeway, R. Lin, T.A. Louis (2006). “Flexible distributions for triple-goal estimates in two-stage hierarchical models,” Computational Statistics and Data Analysis 50(11):3243-3262.

GR estimation routines based on Shen, Wei , and Louis, Thomas A.  (1998), 
``Triple-goal estimates in two-stage hierarchical models'', Journal
of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, Methodological, 60 , 455-471

Dirichlet process mixture simulation based on MacEachern, S. and Mueller, P.
(1998), "Estimating mixture of Dirichlet process models." Journal of
Computational and Graphical Statistics,} 7, 223-238.

T-distribution simulation based on Verdinelli, I. and Wasserman, L.  (1991),
"Bayesian analysis of outlier problems using the Gibbs sampler." Statistics and
Computing, 1, 105-117.
